## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database with a single song 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` with one initial song, run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db` with the initial song *Radar* by Britney spears. 
#### Adding additional songs 
To add an additional song:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.
